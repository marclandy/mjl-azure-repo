# Network Design & Security Enablement for Azure iPaaS  
**Author:** Marc Landy  
**Date:** 2025-05-07

## 🚀 Purpose  
This post outlines critical Azure network architecture and security decisions required to support a scalable and secure Microsoft Azure iPaaS environment. Focus is placed on enabling secure connectivity and integration patterns using Logic Apps Standard, API Management, and Service Bus.

---

## 📘 Use Case : Enables secure intra-Azure connectivity and private access to Azure services from integration components (e.g., Logic Apps, API Mgmt).

## Azure Virtual Network (VNet)

| Design Decision Area      | Guidance |
|---------------------------|----------|
| **Address Space Planning** | Use non-overlapping IP ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`) to avoid conflicts across VNets and on-prem networks. |
| **Subnet Segmentation**   | Organize subnets by function (e.g., integration, apps, data) to isolate workloads and apply targeted controls. |
| **Security Controls**     | Apply NSGs at subnet or NIC level to restrict traffic; use ASGs to group services dynamically. |
| **Private Access**        | Integrate Private Endpoints and Private Link for services like Service Bus, Logic Apps, Key Vault, to restrict public exposure. |

## VNet Peering

| Design Decision Area   | Guidance |
|------------------------|----------|
| **Peering Topology**   | Implement hub-and-spoke for shared service centralization and simplified route management. |
| **Gateway Transit**    | Enable this to share VPN/ExpressRoute gateways from hub to spoke VNets. |
| **Traffic Flow Control** | Ensure bidirectional traffic settings are configured correctly; validate UDRs to ensure proper packet routing. |
| **Cost Optimization**  | Consider that inter-VNet peering traffic incurs cost—optimize data transfer by colocating services where feasible. |

---

## Subnet Design

| Design Decision Area      | Guidance |
|---------------------------|----------|
| **Service-Specific Subnets** | Create dedicated subnets for Logic Apps, App Services, and Azure Integration Services to align with security boundaries. |
| **Subnet Delegation**    | Delegate to appropriate Azure services (e.g., `Microsoft.Web`) to unlock VNet integration and advanced monitoring features. |
| **IP Address Planning**  | Ensure subnets are sized with growth in mind (Azure reserves 5 IPs per subnet). Avoid small /29 subnets unless justified. |
| **Security Boundaries**  | Apply NSGs, UDRs, and service tags to define allowed traffic flows per subnet. |

## VNet Integration for App Services / Logic Apps Standard

| Design Decision Area     | Guidance |
|--------------------------|----------|
| **Outbound Connectivity** | Use VNet Integration to allow apps to securely access backend systems (SAP, SQL, APIs) within the VNet or via ExpressRoute. |
| **Private Ingress Paths** | Use Internal Load Balancers and Private Endpoints to restrict public access to Azure App Services and Logic Apps Standard. |
| **DNS Configuration**     | Leverage Azure Private DNS Zones or custom DNS to resolve internal service names and private endpoints correctly. |
| **NAT Gateway Integration** | Attach a NAT Gateway for outbound connectivity with a fixed public IP (for whitelisting, logging, or compliance). |
