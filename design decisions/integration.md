# Network Design & Security Enablement for Azure iPaaS  
**Author:** Marc Landy  
**Date:** 2025-05-07

## Purpose  
This post outlines critical Azure network architecture and security decisions required to support a scalable and secure Microsoft Azure iPaaS environment. Focus is placed on enabling secure connectivity and integration patterns using Logic Apps Standard, API Management, and Service Bus.

---

## Use Case : Enables secure intra-Azure connectivity and private access to Azure services from integration components (e.g., Logic Apps, API Mgmt).

## Azure Virtual Network (VNet) 

| Design Decision Area      | Guidance |
|---------------------------|----------|
| **Address Space Planning** | Use non-overlapping IP ranges (e.g., `10.0.0.0/16`) to avoid conflicts across VNets and on-prem networks. |
| **Subnet Segmentation**   | Organize subnets by function (e.g., integration, apps, data) to isolate workloads and apply targeted controls. |
| **Security Controls**     | Apply NSGs at subnet or NIC level to restrict traffic; use ASGs to group services dynamically. |
| **Private Access**        | Integrate Private Endpoints and Private Link for services like Service Bus, Logic Apps, Key Vault, to restrict public exposure. |

---

## VNet Peering

| Design Decision Area   | Guidance |
|------------------------|----------|
| **Peering Topology**   | Implement hub-and-spoke for shared service centralization and simplified route management. |
| **Gateway Transit**    | Enable this to share VPN/ExpressRoute gateways from hub to spoke VNets. |
| **Traffic Flow Control** | Ensure bidirectional traffic settings are configured correctly; validate UDRs to ensure proper packet routing. |
| **Cost Optimization**  | Consider that inter-VNet peering traffic incurs cost‚Äîoptimize data transfer by colocating services where feasible. |

---

## Subnet Design

| Design Decision Area      | Guidance |
|---------------------------|----------|
| **Service-Specific Subnets** | Create dedicated subnets for Logic Apps, App Services, and Azure Integration Services to align with security boundaries. |
| **Subnet Delegation**    | Delegate to appropriate Azure services (e.g., `Microsoft.Web`) to unlock VNet integration and advanced monitoring features. |
| **IP Address Planning**  | Ensure subnets are sized with growth in mind (Azure reserves 5 IPs per subnet). Avoid small /29 subnets unless justified. |
| **Security Boundaries**  | Apply NSGs, UDRs, and service tags to define allowed traffic flows per subnet. |

## VNet Integration for App Services / Logic Apps Standard

| Design Decision Area     | Guidance |
|--------------------------|----------|
| **Outbound Connectivity** | Use VNet Integration to allow apps to securely access backend systems (SAP, SQL, APIs) within the VNet or via ExpressRoute. |
| **Private Ingress Paths** | Use Internal Load Balancers and Private Endpoints to restrict public access to Azure App Services and Logic Apps Standard. |
| **DNS Configuration**     | Leverage Azure Private DNS Zones or custom DNS to resolve internal service names and private endpoints correctly. |
| **NAT Gateway Integration** | Attach a NAT Gateway for outbound connectivity with a fixed public IP (for whitelisting, logging, or compliance). |

---

## Use Case : Private Connectivity for Azure iPaaS
**Purpose**: Ensures that integration services are accessed securely over Microsoft's backbone, not the public internet.

| **Aspect**              | **Design Decision**                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**             | Enables private access to PaaS services (API Mgmt, Function Apps, Service Bus) via Azure Private Link                                                        |
| **Security Benefits**   | Eliminates public exposure, restricts access through NSGs and firewalls, supports RBAC and logging                                                            |
| **Network Planning**    | Requires a dedicated subnet per private endpoint (for optimal management), DNS updates to resolve to private IPs                                              |
| **Integration Scope**   | API Mgmt (internal tier), Standard/Isolated Function Apps, Premium-tier Service Bus                                                                           |
| **Monitoring**          | Integrate with NSG flow logs and Azure Monitor to trace and alert on traffic patterns                                                                         |

| **Aspect**              | **Design Decision**                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**             | Provides optimized routing to Azure services over Azure backbone without public internet exposure                                                            |
| **Security Benefits**   | Limits access to specific VNet/subnet by service-level firewall settings                                                                                      |
| **Use Cases**           | Suitable for legacy services or regions where Private Link is not yet available                                                                               |
| **Drawbacks**           | Services are still addressable publicly, and do not support granular control like Private Endpoints                                                           |
| **Modern Guidance**     | Prefer Private Endpoints for new deployments, reserve Service Endpoints for existing integrations or transitional states                                     |
