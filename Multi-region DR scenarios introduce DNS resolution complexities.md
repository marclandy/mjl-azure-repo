# Multi-Region DR Scenarios Introduce DNS Resolution Complexities

## üßæ Technical Executive Summary

### ‚ùó Problem

Azure Site Recovery (ASR) supports private connectivity via **Azure Private Link**.

However, **multi-region Disaster Recovery (DR)** introduces DNS resolution complexities, especially when using centralized or shared **Azure Private DNS Zones**.

- Re-protect operations often **fail** because DNS cannot resolve Private Endpoints in the DR region.

### ‚úÖ Proposed Solution

- Create **regional Private DNS Zones** per region (do not centralize).
- Deploy Private Endpoints for:
  - Recovery Services Vault
  - Cached Storage (Blob)
- Use **region-specific name resolution**, e.g., bind `privatelink.siterecovery.windowsazure.com` to the local VNet.
- Automate deployments using **Bicep**, **Terraform**, or **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**.
- Monitor replication behavior using:
  - **Wireshark**
  - **NSLookup**
  - Azure DNS query logs

### üìò Summary

This guide provides a **practical, IaC-based walkthrough** for implementing multi-region Private Link with Azure Site Recovery (ASR).

It addresses key failure modes‚Äîespecially DNS misconfiguration‚Äîduring:
- Failover
- Re-protect
- Failback cycles

### üß± Key Architecture Components

- ASR Vaults with Private Endpoints in **both regions**
- Blob Storage Private Endpoints in **both regions**
- Two separate VNets, each with **dedicated Private DNS Zones**

### üß† Key Lessons

- **Shared or cross-region DNS resolution is unreliable** in DR scenarios.
- Always **create and bind DNS zones regionally**.
- **Pre-stage** all infrastructure:
  - ASR Vaults
  - Private Endpoints
  - DNS Zones
  - Storage accounts

### üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Techniques

- GitHub repo includes **ARM/Bicep templates**
- **Wireshark** and **NSLookup** validate name resolution paths
- Azure DNS tools for diagnostics and logging
